🎵 To the tune of: “You Are My Sunshine” 🎵

You are my lunch-time, my crispy bacon,
You make my sandwich dreams come true.
With juicy tomatoes, and mayo spreading,
Lettuce like snowfall — crisp and new.

Start with the skillet, not too sizzly,
Lay down that bacon, press it flat.
Golden and even, not too frizzly,
Drain it well, we don’t want fat.

Then take your bread slice, oh so pillowy,
Toast it right in bacon rain.
Spread mayo gently, like you mean it —
Whisper love into that grain.

Add shredded iceberg, like confetti,
Stack thick tomatoes, salt them bold.
Layer bacon, double-deck it,
Corner to corner — firm, not cold.

Now comes the magic: close and press it,
Diagonal slice, the only way.
Hold it up high, show the layers,
Then take a bite — and seize the day.

  title: "Shokupan BLT",
  emoji: "🥓",

  recipe: `
Notes:
Chef Marvin insists on house cured bacon and bread — preferably our house shokupan or something with a delicate crumb and golden crust. He claims the sandwich is a structural miracle if you layer the bacon *just so*. Don’t skip the lettuce or the dramatic 47.5 degree diagonal cut.

Serves: 1

Ingredients:

- 3 strips thick-cut, naturally cured bacon (see notes)
- 2 slices high-quality sandwich bread (shokupan preferred)
- 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
- 1 cup finely shredded iceberg lettuce
- 2 to 4 thick slices ripe tomato
- Coarse sea salt (fleur de sel or Maldon recommended)
- Freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:

1. Place a griddle or skillet over medium-low heat. Add bacon and press it flat using a bacon press or clean masonry trowel.
2. Cook bacon until lightly browned on the first side (about 5 minutes), flip, and continue cooking until fully rendered and crisp (about 3 more minutes).
3. Transfer bacon to a paper towel–lined plate to drain.

4. Using the rendered bacon fat in the pan, toast both sides of the bread slices over medium-low heat until golden brown.

5. Lay toasted bread on a clean surface. Spread mayo on the inner face of both slices.

6. Divide lettuce evenly between both slices. Add thick tomato slices to one side and season generously with salt and pepper.

7. Break bacon strips in half and layer onto the sandwich in two neat rows (three halves per layer, alternating direction for stability).

8. Close the sandwich, press gently, and slice diagonally.

9. Serve immediately while the bacon’s still whispering warm nothings to the tomato.

Equipment:
- Griddle or cast iron skillet
- Bacon press or weight

Special Notes:
- To scale: cook bacon in the oven at 400°F between two parchment-lined trays for 20–25 minutes.
- Duke’s mayo is acceptable. Marvin will judge, but not aloud.
- Use the best summer tomatoes you can find — flavor lives here.
