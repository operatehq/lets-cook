They called her Ma BÃ©. A neighbor, an aunt, a kitchen miracle worker who always smelled like lime and smoke and knew how to dice a shallot so finely it could disappear into thin air.

When I was seven, Iâ€™d sit on an upturned bucket in her courtyard, listening to the sound of garlic hitting hot oil. She never measured. She listened â€” to the sizzle, the pound of the mortar, the way cilantro stems snapped when fresh.

"Good food," sheâ€™d whisper, "isnâ€™t cooked â€” itâ€™s transformed."

Into what? I never asked. Too busy sneaking mint leaves when her back was turned.

She made these meatballs. Pork, leftover rice, fish sauce that could clear your sinuses. Rolled by hand, into perfectly imperfect spheres. Fried until golden, not brown â€” golden. Important distinction. She'd fan the smoke with a sandal and hum a tune no one ever knew the name of.

And then the nuoc cham. Garlic, chiles â€” one hot, one sweet. Lime juice, vinegar, fish sauce, sugar. Always shaken, never stirred. "Taste it with your nose first," she said, and I still donâ€™t know what that means.

Weâ€™d eat them wrapped in lettuce, cucumber slices cooling the fire, herbs flying everywhere. I thought it was magic.

Maybe it still is.

Notes:
Aromatic pork meatballs served warm with crisp lettuce, cucumbers, and nuoc cham. Cilantro stems and mint bring freshness to the mix, while leftover rice adds texture and moisture. Nuoc cham should be made in advance and held cold.
