LANE: Okay. Cake day. Let’s lock this down. You said ricotta — is that in the batter or just the topping?

CHEF MARVIN: Both. It's a two-part poem — crumb and cloud. The ricotta *anchors* the batter, but also *ascends* in the cream. You want it to whisper in both directions.

LANE: …Great. And you said lime?

MARVIN: Six limes. Zest until your wrist questions your decisions. The juice is brightness — like a citrus lighthouse. Not lemon. Not orange. Lime. You need that green lightning.

LANE: And almond flour?

MARVIN: Almond flour is the sigh beneath the structure. It softens the blow. The cake should crumble with dignity, not disintegrate like a freshman soufflé.

LANE: Got it. What’s the fat?

MARVIN: Olive oil. Bold, fruity. Nothing shy. We need it to shimmer. Brush it in the pan, pour it in the mix. And turbinado — sprinkle it like a spell.

LANE: One or two eggs?

MARVIN: Two. But treat them like guests. Don’t beat them like they owe you rent. Introduce them gently to the lime-sugar perfume.

LANE: Vanilla?

MARVIN: Extract or paste. I prefer paste. It's got gravitas. Use what the pantry gives you.

LANE: For the topping — we’re whipping ricotta?

MARVIN: Ricotta, sugar, vanilla, cream. Whip until it holds like a memory. It should feel like the lovechild of mascarpone and ambition.

LANE: And the berries?

MARVIN: Macerate them. Sugar, lime juice, a whisper of salt. They should taste like summer left the door open.

LANE: Bake time?

MARVIN: Until golden and crackled. A skewer must exit clean. It will tell you when it’s ready.

LANE: …Alright. I think I can work with this.

  recipe: `
Notes:
A bright, plush olive oil cake made with almond flour, ricotta, and fresh lime. Served with whipped ricotta cream and macerated strawberries. Ideal for summer service or plated dessert.

Yield: One 9" x 5" loaf

Ingredients:

Dry:
- 1½ cups all-purpose flour
- ⅔ cup almond flour
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- ¾ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda

Wet:
- Zest of 5 limes
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup extra virgin olive oil
- ½ cup ricotta (full-fat)
- ½ cup fresh lime juice (from ~6 limes)
- 1 tsp vanilla paste or 2 tsp extract

For the pan:
- Olive oil, for greasing
- Turbinado sugar

Whipped ricotta topping:
- 1½ cups ricotta (full-fat)
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1¼ cups heavy cream
- Pinch of salt

Strawberries:
- 1 quart strawberries, hulled and halved/quartered
- 2 tbsp sugar (more if berries are underripe)
- Juice of 1 lime
- Pinch of salt

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Brush a 9" x 5" loaf pan with olive oil, line with parchment, and coat interior with turbinado sugar.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk flours, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.

3. In a separate bowl, combine lime zest and sugar. Rub together with fingers to infuse. Whisk in eggs until smooth, then slowly whisk in olive oil. Add ricotta, lime juice, and vanilla. Stir until combined.

4. Fold dry ingredients into wet until just incorporated. Do not overmix. Transfer batter to prepared pan and sprinkle top with turbinado sugar.

5. Bake on center rack for 60–75 minutes, until golden, cracked, and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool slightly, then loosen edges with a knife and remove from pan.

6. For whipped ricotta: Process ricotta, sugar, and vanilla in food processor until smooth (~1 min). Add cream and salt, and whip until fluffy (30–60 sec). Chill until service.

7. For strawberries: Toss with sugar, lime juice, and salt. Chill until juices release (~15–30 min). Can be made up to 24 hrs in advance.

8. To serve: Slice cake into 1" slices. Plate with whipped ricotta and strawberries with their juices.

Service Notes:
- Whipped ricotta can be made 1 day in advance and held cold.
- Macerated berries hold well but should be drained slightly before plating to avoid pooling.
- Do not substitute skim or low-fat ricotta.
