Hereâ€™s what I donâ€™t understand: standing desks. You want to stand? Then *stand*. Why does your desk need a motor? Weâ€™ve got thermostats you talk to and toasters with Bluetooth, but ask someone to soak beans overnight and they act like youâ€™ve slapped their grandmother.

Thereâ€™s no app for cassoulet. No shortcut. You soak the beans in salted water â€” *overnight*. No negotiation. You render the salt pork. You brown the pork shoulder. You nestle the duck in gently â€” skin side up like itâ€™s royalty. And no, you donâ€™t skip the duck fat. You **never** skip the duck fat.

You layer. You donâ€™t dump. First the beans, then the meat, then the beans again. You add stock like you're telling a secret â€” slow, on the side of the pot. And yes, you can use gelatin if your stockâ€™s watery. No shame in that. But if youâ€™re using pre-salted store-bought broth? Get out of my kitchen.

And the crust. You *must* break the crust. Not once â€” three, maybe four times. Break it with a spoon. Shake the pot. Let it reform. That crust is earned. You donâ€™t just pop it under a broiler like a fool with a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e torch.

Garlic sausage. Duck leg â€” fresh or confit. A head of garlic, whole. Aromatics go in, but they *come out*. You donâ€™t serve someone a bay leaf and call it rustic. You cook it slow. You keep it honest.

Cassoulet is discipline, Lane. Itâ€™s time layered with fat. Itâ€™s patience you can eat.

  recipe: `
Notes:
A traditional cassoulet with duck, garlic sausage, and pork cooked with white beans in a rich, gelatinous stock. A deep crust is essential. The dish should be prepared and served in the same vessel â€” ideally a wide Dutch oven or copper gratin.

Serves: 6 to 8

Ingredients:

- 1 lb dried cannellini beans
- 3 tbsp kosher salt
- 5 cups unsalted chicken stock, divided
- 3 packets unflavored gelatin (omit if using well-gelled stock)
- 2 tbsp duck fat (optional)
- 8 oz salt pork, Â¾-inch dice
- 8 oz pork shoulder, 1-inch dice
- 4 duck legs (confit or fresh) or chicken thighs
- 1 lb garlic sausage (cut into 2â€“4 segments)
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 1 medium carrot, cut into 3-inch chunks
- 2 ribs celery, cut into 3-inch chunks
- 1 head garlic, halved crosswise
- 4 sprigs parsley
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 whole cloves
- White pepper, freshly ground

Instructions:

1. Soak beans overnight in salted water (3 qts water + 3 tbsp salt). Drain and rinse before cooking.

2. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. In a measuring cup, combine 4 cups stock with gelatin and set aside.

3. In a Dutch oven, heat duck fat over high heat. Brown salt pork and pork shoulder until golden (~9 min). Transfer to bowl, leaving rendered fat in pan.

4. Season duck or chicken with pepper. Sear skin-side down until deeply browned (~6â€“8 min). Remove and let cool.

5. Brown sausage in same pan (~2 min/side). Transfer to bowl with pork. Drain excess fat, leaving 2 tbsp in pan.

6. Add diced onion; cook until translucent (~4 min), scraping up fond. Add drained beans, carrot, celery, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, cloves, and stock mixture. Bring to simmer, cover, and cook on low heat until beans are just tender (~20 min).

7. Remove aromatics (carrot, celery, parsley, bay, cloves). Stir in pork and sausage. Beans should be just submerged. Transfer uncovered to oven and cook 90 minutes, adding remaining stock halfway through to keep beans moist.

8. Break crust with spoon, gently shake to redistribute. Nestle duck/chicken into top, skin side up. Return to oven. Continue baking for 90 minutes, breaking crust every 30 min, until dark brown and set.

Service Notes:
- Dish must be served hot, straight from the oven.
- Crust should be deep, golden, and broken several times during cooking.
- Do not stir vigorously â€” crust should reform between breaks.
- Garnish is not traditional and should be avoided.

Equipment:
- Wide Dutch oven or copper gratin
- Slotted spoon
