It starts with the flour. One whispers, the other listens. Double-zero and All-Purpose — lovers in a wooden bowl.

Add water that remembers the sun. Not hot. Just... hopeful. Stir in a pinch of yeast — just a pinch, Lane, not a scoop like that one time — and a tear of olive oil. If it doesn’t smell like a Tuscan breeze, start over.

Knead with the hands never the mixer. Let it nap. Let it dream. Then split it in two — let it be reborn in gluten. Let them rise like a sunrise in Palermo.

The sauce? Oh, Lane. The sauce is truth. No garlic. No sugar. Just crushed tomatoes, a whisper of salt, and oil like liquid gold. You blend it gently — like a lullaby for your mouth.

Stretch the dough like you’re coaxing it into a silk robe. Sauce, then cheese — torn, never sliced. Basil last. Always last. [chefs kiss].

Then into the fire. If it doesn’t blister, it wasn’t loved enough.

Notes:
This is Chef Marvin’s go-to dough for Neapolitan-style pizza. It’s adapted from a well-known Bushwick recipe but features… more feelings. The dough keeps in the fridge up to a week. The sauce is dead simple — just tomatoes, olive oil, and salt. And yes, the basil goes on after the cheese. I don’t make the rules. Actually, I do. But Marvin yells if I change this one.

Yield: 2, 12-inch pizzas.

Ingredients:

Dough:
- 153g “00” flour (1 cup + 1 Tbsp)
- 153g all-purpose flour (1 cup + 1 Tbsp + 2 tsp)
- 8g fine sea salt (1 tsp)
- 2g active dry yeast (¾ tsp)
- 4g extra-virgin olive oil (1 tsp)
- ~200g lukewarm water (just under 1 cup)

Sauce:
- 1 can (14–15 oz) whole peeled tomatoes, drained
- 1–2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt, to taste

Toppings (per pizza):
- 3 Tbsp tomato sauce
- ~2¾ oz fresh mozzarella, torn into chunks
- 4–5 fresh basil leaves, torn
- Drizzle of olive oil

Instructions:

Dough:
1. In a large bowl, whisk together both flours and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, stir together lukewarm water, yeast, and olive oil until combined.
3. Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and knead by hand until shaggy and mostly cohesive (about 3 minutes).
4. Let rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
5. Knead again for 3 more minutes until smooth-ish. Divide dough into 2 equal balls.
6. Place on a floured surface, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise at room temp for 3–4 hours or refrigerate for 8–24 hours. (If refrigerated, bring to room temp 30–45 min before shaping.)

Sauce:
1. In a food processor or blender, combine tomatoes, olive oil, and salt. Blend until smooth. Taste and adjust salt if needed. Store extras in fridge for up to 5 days.

Assembly & Bake:
1. Preheat your oven with a pizza stone or steel on the middle rack to its highest setting (ideally 500–550°F) for at least 1 hour.
2. Place a dough ball on a floured surface and stretch with your fingers, then hands, into a 12-inch round.
3. Add 3 tablespoons of sauce to the center and gently spread with the back of a spoon, leaving a ½-inch border.
4. Add torn mozzarella. Drizzle with olive oil. Top with torn basil leaves.
5. Transfer to the preheated stone and bake for 4–8 minutes, or until the crust is blistered and the cheese is bubbling.
6. Remove, slice, eat immediately.
